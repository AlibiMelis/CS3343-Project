# Processes-Scheduler

Process Scheduler is a console application that schedules processes using different scheduling algorithms and displays the results of each for future analysis. During scheduling, the system calculates all essential details and then suggests the best algorithm according to chosen criteria. It can be used to demonstrate the behavior and efficiency of scheduling algorithms for different use cases.
The program is designed primarily for developers. Developers can create mock processes and run them through a scheduler and analyze results. 

- User is able to input file with data into the system
- User can launch scheduler after the system received input data successfully
- Scheduling is performed using:
  - FCFS (First-Come-First-Served), 
  - RR (Round-Robin), FB (Feedback), 
  - Shortest Process Next (SPN), 
  - Shortest Remaining Time (SRT), 
  - Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN) 
  scheduling algorithms 
- System outputs all important details (turnaround time, queuing time, etc) as a result of scheduling
